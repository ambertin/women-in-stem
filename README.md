Lovelace made notes on how the engine could be used to handle not just numbers, but letters and symbols, and also theorized the method of code looping. Her contributions had little to no impact while she was alive and were not known on a widespread scale until 1953, when her work was published by BV Bowden in *Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines*.
