# Women in Math, Stats, and CS –– Card Profiles

## **Hearts**

### Ada Lovelace

Ada Lovelace was an mathematician from the 1800s. She is considered by many to be the first ever computer programmer for writing an algorithm for a computing machine called the analytical engine, which was developed by inventor Charles Babbage. Lovelace made notes on how the engine could be used to handle not just numbers, but letters and symbols, and also theorized the method of code looping. Her contributions had little to no impact while she was alive and were not known on a widespread scale until 1953, when her work was published by BV Bowden in *Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines*.

### Adele Goldberg

Adele Goldberg is a computer scientist, known for being one of the creators of the programming language Smalltalk-80, which was hugely influential to the development of many of the world's top object-oriented programming languages today (Java, Python, Ruby, etc.). Smalltalk also proved to be a key tool in the development of the agile development methodology, which centers on the idea of iterative development.

### Anita Borg

Anita Borg was a computer scientist who founded the [Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing](https://ghc.anitab.org)---an annual series of conferences designed to highlight the work of women in computing---and the [Institute for Women in Technology](https://anitab.org)---a nonprofit focused on recruiting and advancing women in the technology sector.

### Annie Easley

Annie Easley was a mathematician and computer programmer who broke down barriers for women and people of color in tech. She was one of the first African-American employees to serve as a human computer at NASA, eventually working as a programmer to develop rockets and hybrid battery technology. She was very invested in outreach efforts, participating in tutoring programs at schools and working to inspire women and minorities to go into STEM.

### Betty Jean Bartik 

Betty Jean Bartik, also known as just Jean Bartik or Betty Jean Jennings, was one of the original programmers of the ENIAC (Electronic Numeric Integrator and Computer), which was developed at the end of WWII to calculate ballistic trajectories for military weapons. It was the first large scale computer of its kind, paving the way for many of the modern computers of today. Bartik and her colleagues worked to develop many of the fundamentals of programming and---arguably---to develop the discipline of computer programming itself.

### Betty Snyder Holberton

Betty Holberton, like Betty Jean Bartik, was also one of the original programmers of the ENIAC. She helped write the first ever sort/merge function using binary trees and also wrote the first statistical analysis package.

### Bin Yu

Bin Yu is currently Chancellor's Professor in the Departments of Statistics and Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley. She has done a lot of important work around creating a framework for veridical data science, which focuses on ["responsible, reliable, reproducible, and transparent analysis"](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/8/3920) and is also known for investigating the theory behind the method of [deep learning](https://data.berkeley.edu/news/uc-berkeley-lead-10m-nsfsimons-foundation-program-investigate-theoretical-underpinnings-deep).
