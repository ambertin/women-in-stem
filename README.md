# Women in Math, Stats, and CS –– Card Profiles


Welcome to the homepage for my women in Math, Stats, and CS playing cards. I created these cards with the goal of educating others about the impact that women have had in STEM and getting more women excited to participate in the field! No profit was made in the creation and distribution of these decks–all proceeds were donated to charities supporting the engagement of women in STEM.

### Ada Lovelace (A)

Ada Lovelace was an mathematician from the 1800s. She is considered by many to be the first ever computer programmer for writing an algorithm for a computing machine called the [analytical engine](https://blogs.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/adalovelace/2018/07/26/ada-lovelace-and-the-analytical-engine/), which was developed by inventor Charles Babbage. Lovelace made notes on how the engine could be used to handle not just numbers, but letters and symbols, and also theorized the method of code looping. Her contributions had little to no impact while she was alive and were not known on a widespread scale until 1953, when her work was published by BV Bowden in [*Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines*](https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.49708034340).
